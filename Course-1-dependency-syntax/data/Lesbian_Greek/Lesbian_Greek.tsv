η	the	DET	Case=Nom|Definite=Def|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing|PronType=Art	Although in Standard Modern Greek, the definite articles for masculine (ο [o]), feminine (η [i]), and neuter (το [to]) in the nominative singular are distinct, in Lesbian Greek there is only a distinction between masculine/feminine and neuter. Specifically, the form of the feminine article has prevailed for both masculine and feminine genders. Furthermore, in the rest of the inflectional paradigm, the distinction between grammatical genders is maintained.   Should we retain the distinction between masculine and feminine in the column of morphological features for the nominative case, even though the same form is used?
γι-άντρας	husband	NOUN	Case=Nom|Gender=Masc|Number=Sing	Epenthesis (such as γι- [ʝ-]) between a functional word (line 58) and a word (line 59) is very common in the dialect to achieve a CVCV sequence. How should we handle this null phonetic element (see also line 74 for the same word without this phonetic element)? What approach should we take for tokenization and lemmatization?

δ’λειά	job	NOUN	Case=Acc|Gender=Fem|Number=Sing	Comparing sent_id = 7 & 8, you can see that in the dialectal sources, apostrophes are not used systematically due to the lack of standardization. In Standard Modern Greek, apostrophes are used to mark the loss of vowels only at word boundaries. However, in the dialect, apostrophes are used to indicate vowel loss both within words and at word boundaries. Since the deletion of unstressed /i/ and /e/ in the dialect follows a rule, apostrophes, when used, are quite frequent. However, this usage is not consistent across all sources (compare with line 94). The same variability applies to the use of dashes (as seen in lines 54 and 39).    How should we handle these characters in terms of tokenization and lemmatization? Should we keep all this variation documented in the writing system of the different sources?

νταγιαντίζιτι	is bearable	VERB	Aspect=Imp|Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Pres|Voice=Pass	Due to the history of the dialect, numerous Turkish borrowings are documented. However, the dialect integrates borrowed verbs in two ways: (a) with a derivational suffix (i.e., -ιζ- [-iz]), as exemplified here, or (b) without a derivational suffix, as in line 117 of the next example (sent_id = 10). Consequently, there would be two different lemmas (νταγιαντίζω [daʝa'ndizo] and νταγιαντώ [daʝa'ndo]) that mean exactly the same thing. Is this the correct approach to handle such cases? Variation in (verb) loan integration is also observed in many other languages and dialects.
